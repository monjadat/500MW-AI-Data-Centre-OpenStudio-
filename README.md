# AI Data Center Energy Model (OpenStudio)

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains an OpenStudio model of a **500 MW hyperscale AI data center** located in **Abu Dhabi**, representing extreme hot-climate conditions.  

The model focuses on:  
- 💧 **Direct-to-Chip (D2C) liquid cooling**  
- 💡 **Minimal lighting and occupancy loads**  
- 🌬️ **Dedicated Outdoor Air System (DOAS)** with dehumidification  
- 💦 **Water use and heat recovery estimation**  

The goal is to evaluate **energy performance**, **cooling strategies**, and **water consumption** under challenging desert climates.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- **`model/`** – OpenStudio files (`.osm`), weather file (`.epw`), and measures  
- **`results/`** – Processed outputs, plots, and reports (auto-generated by scripts)  
- **`scripts/`** – Python scripts for post-processing (`extract_and_plot.py`)  
- **`docs/`** – Methodology notes, HVAC schematics, workflow diagrams, references  
- **`README.md`** – You are here

## 🚀 How to Run the Model and Generate Results

### 1. Requirements
- [OpenStudio](https://openstudio.net/) (tested with version 3.10.0)  
- Python 3.10+ with the following libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas matplotlib

### 2. Run the OpenStudio Simulation
1. Open `model/base_model.osm` in OpenStudio.
2. Ensure the Abu Dhabi weather file (`model/AbuDhabi.epw`) is linked.
3. Run the simulation (this will generate `eplusout.sql` in `model/run/`).

### 3. Extract Results and generate plots
1. From the project root, run:
python scripts/extract_and_plot.py --sql model/run/eplusout.sql

2. Outputs will appear in the results/ folder:
timeseries_daily.csv — daily energy & water use
timeseries_hourly.csv — hourly merged timeseries
kpis.csv — headline KPIs (e.g., PUE, total HVAC energy, water use)
daily_facility.png, daily_hvac.png, daily_water.png, pue.png

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository:

   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/AI-DataCenter-OpenStudio.git](https://github.com/monjadat/500MW-AI-Data-Centre-OpenStudio-.git)

2. Run the OpenStudio simulation.
3. Execute the Python post-processing script as described above
